## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of the course, students will be able to:

- **CO1:** Demonstrate the ability to identify the type of a given function, approximate its limit both numerically and graphically as well as its continuity at a given point or determine the intervals of continuity of the function  
- **CO2:** Determine the differentiability and integrability of functions using the concepts of limits and continuity  
- **CO3:** Differentiate various types of functions comprising both the implicit and explicit types using different methods and apply differentiation to determine the rate of change and maxima and minima of functions  
- **CO4:** Evaluate the Integrals associated with different types of functions either by using the integral table or substitution technique; interpret the geometric meaning of integral and apply this concept to solve geometric and physical problems, such as finding the area under curves
